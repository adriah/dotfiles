DISCLAIMER
This code is poorly written, I take no responsibility if anything happens at
all, even remotely, to you, your system, your network, your girlfriend, your
pet, your family, your imaginary friend, your house, your porn, or anything
at all that may come as a result of the usage, viewing, editing, etc. of this
code.
If it is so horrible that your eyes melt onto your laptop, causing it to
short-circuit, explode, and kill you, that is *your responsibility*.
